Paul Revere
===========

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/thoughtbot/paul_revere.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/thoughtbot/paul_revere)

Simple announcement plugin to include "one off" style announcements in Rails web apps.

Install with the asset pipeline (Rails 3.1+, asset pipeline enabled)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Install as normal in your Gemfile:

    gem 'paul_revere'

Run the generator to create the migration:

    rails generate paul_revere

Add the announcement JS to `app/assets/javascripts/application.js`:

    //= require announcements

Run the migration:

    rake db:migrate && rake db:migrate:redo

Install without the asset pipeline (Rails 3.0 or asset pipeline disabled)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Install as normal in your Gemfile:

    gem 'paul_revere'

Run the generator to create the migration and copy the JavaScript file into public:

    rails generate paul_revere

Add the announcement JS to your layout, such as `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb`:

    <%= javascript_include_tag 'announcements' %>

Run the migration:

    rake db:migrate && rake db:migrate:redo

Usage
-----

Paul Revere provides...

* A model called `Announcement`, which has nothing more than timestamps and a "body" column (text column).  We view the most recent `Announcement` as the "current" announcement, and will select that to show on the site.
* A helper called `#current_announcement`, which will return that latest `Announcement` record.
* A view partial called `_announcement_for_all`, which is intended to be shown to all site users.
* A view partial called `_announcement`, which is intended to be shown only to logged in users.
* A view partial called `_email_announcement`, which is intended to be used in site emails which are sent out.

So the flow would be...

* Install the gem
* Use those partials in the correct places in your view code and mailer view code where you want announcements to show up:

    <%= render 'announcements/announcement_for_all' %>

* When you want to make an announcement, use the Rails console to create a new `Announcement` record:

    Announcement.create!(body: 'This Web site is shutting down because you refuse to pay')

Beastie Boys Lyrics
-------------------

<p>Now here’s a little story I’ve got to tell<br />
About three bad brothers you know so well<br />
It started way back in history<br />
With Adrock, M.C.A., and me - Mike D.</p>

<p>Been had a little horsy named Paul Revere<br />
Just me and my horsy and a quart of beer<br />
Riding across the land, kicking up sand<br />
Sheriff’s posse on my tail cause I’m in demand<br />
One lonely Beastie I be<br />
All by myself without nobody<br />
The sun is beating down on my baseball hat<br />
The air is gettin’ hot the beer is getting flat<br />
Lookin’ for a girl I ran into a guy<br />
His name is M.C.A., I said, “Howdy” he said, “Hi”</p>

<p>He told a little story that sounded well rehearsed<br />
Four days on the run and that he’s dying of thirst<br />
The brew was in my hand and he was on my tip<br />
His voice was hoarse, his throat was dry he asked me for a sip<br />
He said, “Can I get some?”<br />
I said, “You can’t get none!”<br />
Had a chance to run<br />
He pulled out his shotgun<br />
He was quick on the draw I thought I’d be dead<br />
He put the gun to my head and this is what he said,</p>

<p>“Now my name is M.C.A. I’ve got a license to kill<br />
I think you know what time it is it’s time to get ill<br />
Now what do we have here an outlaw and his beer<br />
I run this land, you understand I make myself clear.”</p>

<p>We stepped into the wind he had a gun, I had a grin<br />
You think this story’s over but it’s ready to begin</p>

<p>“Now I got the gun you got the brew<br />
You got two choices of what you can do<br />
It’s not a tough decision as you can see<br />
I can blow you away or you can ride with me”</p>

<p>I said, I’ll ride with you if you can get me to the border<br />
The sheriff’s after me for what I did to his daughter<br />
I did it like this, I did it like that<br />
I did it with a whiffleball bat<br />
So I’m on the run the cop’s got my gun<br />
And right about now it’s time to have some fun<br />
The King Adrock that is my name<br />
And I know the fly spot where they got the champagne.&quot;<br />
We rode for six hours then we hit the spot<br />
The beat was a bumping and the girlies was hot<br />
This dude was staring like he knows who we are<br />
We took the empty spot next to him at the bar<br />
M.C.A. said, “Yo, you know this kid?”<br />
I said, “I didn’t.” but I know he did<br />
The kid said, “Get ready cause this ain’t funny<br />
My name’s Mike D. and I’m about to get money.”<br />
Pulled out the jammy aimed it at the sky<br />
He yelled, “Stick ’em up!” and let two fly<br />
Hands went up and people hit the floor<br />
He wasted two kids that ran for the door<br />
“I’m Mike D. and I get respect<br />
Your cash and your jewelry is what I expect”<br />
M.C.A. was with it and he’s my ace<br />
So I grabbed the piano player and I punched him in the face<br />
The piano player’s out the music stopped<br />
His boy had beef and he got dropped<br />
Mike D. grabbed the money M.C.A. snatched the gold<br />
I grabbed two girlies and a beer that’s cold.</p>
